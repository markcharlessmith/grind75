/*Problem: Reverse Words in a Sentence

Implement a function reverseWords that takes a sentence as input and returns a new sentence where the words are reversed, while preserving the order of the words.

Example:

typescript
Copy code
reverseWords("Hello, world!") // Output: "world! Hello,"
Note:

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The input sentence will not contain leading or trailing spaces.
The words in the sentence will be separated by a single space.
Write your solution in TypeScript, using string and array methods as necessary.*/
